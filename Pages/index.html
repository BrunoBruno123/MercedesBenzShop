                    <h1>Martin Brudermüller, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Mercedes-Benz Group AG</h1>
                    <p>“Two outstanding managers from our own ranks, Jörg Burzer and Michael Schiebe, are taking over key divisions that are of decisive importance for the future success of Mercedes-Benz Group. In recent years, Jörg Burzer has taken vehicle production at Mercedes-Benz to a new level with vision, consistency and a clear focus on innovation, flexibility and efficiency. His impressive strength in execution and his ability to combine technological developments with industrial realization make him the ideal choice to lead and further develop Development & Procurement. Michael Schiebe brings more than 20 years of highly varied experience at Mercedes-Benz, which he will apply to leading and continuously enhancing the division of Production, Quality & Supply Chain Management. Most recently at Mercedes-AMG, he has demonstrated how he combines strategic thinking and decisive action with operational excellence to great effect. We expect further improvements in our competitiveness through even closer cooperation between Production and Development.
                        With Markus Schäfer we say farewell to a highly esteemed colleague, who commands the highest respect both internally and externally. As the architect of our technology strategy, he has been instrumental in driving Mercedes-Benz’s transformation from a traditional car manufacturer to the electrification of our portfolio and the integration of digital systems. The current product offensive clearly bears his signature. His commitment to technological excellence and his deep connection to the Mercedes-Benz brand are reflected not only in his long-standing service to the company but also in his role as Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Mercedes-Benz Grand Prix Ltd. On behalf of the entire Supervisory Board, I thank Markus Schäfer for his outstanding achievements and wish him every possible success for the future.”</p>
